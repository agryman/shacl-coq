Formal specification of W3C SHACL in Coq

The repository contains a formal specification of the [W3C RDF Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) using the Coq Proof Assistant system. The motivation for writing a formal specification is to provide a well-founded semantics for SHACL in the presence of certain forms of recursion.
